These are general notes on how the 8080 cpu works, how much memory, registers, etc.
8080asm.pdf contains each different instruction in detail.
General:
    8-bit single chip CPU
    78 total instructions to implement
    65536(0xFFFFH) bytes of memory(RAM) <-- check dis
    Unlimited Stack space
    Seven 8-bit registers
    Program Counter-> where next instruction will be executed
    Stack Pointer -> pointer to the subroutine and interrupts

Registers:
    The Program Counter(PC) and Stack Pointer(SP) are both 16-bit
    7 8-bit Registers, are refered by letter and number are:
        B(0), C(1), D(2), E(3), H(4), L(5), A(7)
        A is the accumulator register
    Some instructions are refered to with pairs with the same letter, There are four pairs:
        B(B&C), D(D&E), H(H&L) and PSW
        PSW refers to A register and all flags in the cpu which creates 8 bits.
        The pairs all form to create a 16 bit instruction.

Flags/Conditional Bits:
    Exists 5 different flags to indicate results of instructions:
    Sign(S), set if result is negative
    Zero(Z), set if result is zero
    Parity(P), checks the amount of 1 bits in a byte, if the total is even P flag is set to 1.
    Carry(C), sets if operation resulted in carry or required a borrow
    Auxiliary carry(AC or H), used in BCD, also set if the 3rd bit in arithmetric is carried, only used in DAA instruction

Instructions:
    Instructions can either be 1, 2 or 3 bytes in instructions, it is known from the opcode.
 
Memory map:

    $0800-$0fff:    invaders.g
    $1000-$17ff:    invaders.f
    $1800-$1fff:    invaders.e

    RAM
    $2000-$23ff:    work RAM
    $2400-$3fff:    video RAM

    $4000-:         RAM mirror
